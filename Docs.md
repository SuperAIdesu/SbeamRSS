## Quick start

### Adding RSS sources

After installation, you need to add some RSS subscription sources to begin your reading. To do this, switch to the "Source" section and press the "add" button.

#### Where to find RSS source links?

Most news websites come with an RSS feed link, so you can check your favorite website for one. [RSShub](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/) also provides a variety of RSS sources. It's worth noting that the app **only supports RSS feeds that contain full text articles**, and feeds that don't meet this requirement can't be parsed correctly. Thus source links from RSShub is preferred as they usually contain full text. For websites that don't provide an RSS feed, there are plenty of tools on the web to generate one from these sites.

### Fetching feeds

Pull down from the "Feeds" page to fetch new articles. It will take a long time if multiple sources have been added.

### Begin Reading

Simply press on an article to read full text. You can share, open the article in browser and customize fonts by pressing the topright button.

## Q&A
